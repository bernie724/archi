# archi
### Purpose
A personal set of scripts to fully automate (no interaction) the installation of Arch Linux as a complete Desktop System. 

I am moving systems away from distro package managers (as much as I can) to be more nimble as an operator, in so creating clean modular deployments, and maintaining such systems with an intelligent administrative experience. I rely heavily on flatpak for this deployment.

I have nothing to do with Arch Linux or flatpak for that matter, this is for my personal use.

Make sure to read: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide 

**WARNING:** Do not run these scripts anywhere but on a booted Arch Linux Install ISO [VM is Only Recommended].  **These scripts will Obliterate any system with root access.**  These scripts are for testing and fun only!!!
#### Pre Install
Boot the latest Arch Linux Install ISO on the system that will do a **full and complete** install. [VirutualBox Guest is the only install tested] 

Copy and unpack the archi.tgz file to the booted Arch Install ISO  
```sh
scp username@10.0.0.1:/tmp/archi.tgz .
tar xzpf archi.tgz # for gzip
```
#### Configuring the scripts (optional)
I would review and leave the settings for the first run, these scripts dont have a lot of checks yet, the config file is archi/archi.conf and The install sets are located @ archi/forsys/sets 

e.g. vim/nano archi.conf to suit your install. default: user archi pass archi [the script will tell you]

#### Install Overview
The install is **two commands** with **NO** interaction:

|Step  | Script | Info                                                             |
| ---- | ------ | ----                                                             |
| 1    | arch0base.sh    | this is format/base/sanity and to chroot                |
| 2    | arch0install.sh | this is after arch-chroot, bootloader/desktop/apps      |

#### Start Install
```sh
#To start run from the unpacked archi.tgz archi/ directory
cd archi/; ./arch0base.sh
#The dialog at the end gives instructions to start the second script.
cd /usr/local/archi; ./arch0install.sh 
```
##### When complete, the total system is installed, with all included flatpaks and a Desktop GUI (xfce4)

#### Conclusion

With these scripts I can move away from all distro package managers on all Desktop (GUI) systems I create. Â  
This script creates a clean, snappy (pun) Arch desktop that is manageable, safe and fun. 
My basic desktop requirements are, a granite like stability at the core and futuristic application availability in the operator space.

If you use, test or try these scripts '**Thank You**'. Any feedback, fixes, improvements, whatnot would be nice.
